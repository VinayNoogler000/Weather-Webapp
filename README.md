## 📖 Overview

A simple and responsive weather web application that provides real-time weather information for any location. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface. The design is created using [Bolt](#-acknowledgments) and built using [Tailwind CSS](#-acknowledgments), ensuring a modern and clean look.

## 📚 Learnings

Throughout the development of Weather Webapp, several key learnings and insights were gained:

1. **Different sizes of favicon are required**, so that the browser can use the appropriate size according to the devices, and if multiple sizes are not used, then the browser may need to adjust the size of the image automatically, decreasing the quality of the image. The sizes are `16x16`, `32x32`, `48x48,` and `64x64` pixels.
2. **ImageMagick** can be used to convert and merge multiple types of images (like `.png`) into a single image (like `.ico`) file, which is used as a favicon for the webapp. 
3. **Using `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes of anchor `<a>` tags** are important for security & privacy reasons, especially when using `target="_blank"` to open links in a new tab, as these attributes prevent the new page from accessing the original page's `window` object by using `window.opener`, and also prevent the referrer (or original page) information from being sent to the new page, respectively.
4. **Lucide Icons** provides a collection of free and open-source icons that can be used in web applications. It is a great alternative to Font Awesome, as it is lightweight and customizable.
5. **Adding background gradient from top left to bottom left or any other direction** by using Vanilla CSS and Tailwind's Utility Classes.
6. **Using `@theme` directve in Tailwind-CSS to define custom design tokens, which directly maps with Tailwind's Utility Classes**, allowing us/devs to easily apply styling by using custom variables.
7. **Adding Copyright Notice** in the footer element of the website, to legally own/hold all the rights. A copyright notice consists of 4 parts: Copyright word or © symbol, year of creation of the product (or any other thing), name of the invidiual or business, and the rights you hold -generally, "All Rights Reserved".
8. **Meta Tags**: Various meta tags can be used to improve SEO and user experience.
   - Meta Robots Tag: Controls how search engines index and follow your page.
   For eg: `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />`
   - Meta Theme-Color: Sets the browser toolbar color on mobile devices. For eg: `<meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />`
   - Meta Open Graph Tags: Improve how your site appears when shared on social media. For eg: `<meta property="og:title" content="Weather Webapp" />`
   - Meta Twitter Card Tags: Enhance Twitter sharing. For eg: `<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />`
   - Link Canonical Tag: Prevents duplicate content issues by specifying the preferred URL. For eg: `<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/" />`
9. **Different types of `<script> tags`** can be used to load JavaScript files in a web page. For eg:
   - `text/javascript`: The default type for JavaScript files, in which the browser doesn't support import/export statements, but the Node.js runtime does support them, by interepreting the code as CommonJS modules. And, commonJS modules are loaded synchronously, which means that the code is executed in the order it is written.
   - `module`: It's used to make the JS run-time environment (browser or node.js) interpret JS files as ES6 modules, which support import/export statements. And, ES6 modules are loaded asynchronously, which means that the code is executed in parallel with the rest of the page.
   - `Other Types`: There are other types of `<script>` tags, like `text/babel`, `text/typescript`, etc., which are used to load files written in other languages, like Babel and TypeScript, respectively. And, older (uncommon) types like `application/javascript`, `text/ecmascript`, `application/ecmascript`, etc., are also used to load JS files, but they are not recommended to be used, as they are not widely supported by modern browsers.

These learnings contributed significantly to the robustness and user experience of the Weather Webapp, as well as to my Software Development concepts.

## 🗓️ What My Daily Life Looks Like?
As of now (latest version of this README file), I'm building Web Dev Internship Projects, in both Frontend & Backend, thriving to become a Full-Stack Web Developer, while learning about Databases, and AI Tech-Trends.

This project/website is my 10th self-made Frontend Web project (previous one was [Password Generator](https://github.com/VinayNoogler000/Password-Generator)), made to strengthen my Frontend Web Development Skills.

In Frontend Web Development, as of now, I have already completed 10 projects (incl. this), and after completing my internship, I'll be starting with revision of React.js (with Redux), which then, I'll be using to build at least 3-5 projects, to strengthen my fundamentals and become more confident in Frontend Web Development.

While building frontend web development projects, after internship, I will be also continue learning about Backend Web Development, and MongoDB Database, so that I can become skilled in Backend Web Development.

In between, I take out time daily, to explore about other demanding and valuable upcoming technologies (like AI-Agents using MCP Servers), even if it's for just 30 minutes, to keep myself updated with the latest trends in the tech world.

At last, after Completing Frontend Development Projects, and Learning Backend Development, I'll be making at least 3-4 Major Full-Stack Projects, using MERN tech-stack, going from small-to-big, so that I can become a really commendable Full-Stack Web Developer, by connecting my Frontend and Backend skills together.
